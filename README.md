# QCloud Workshop

**Using IBM Quantum Computers in the Cloud**

## Overview

QCloud is a 4-day hands-on workshop that teaches how to deploy, run, and integrate quantum programs on IBM Quantum Cloud.
Students already familiar with quantum computing will learn the cloud workflow: from writing circuits, to running them on real hardware, to exporting results and using them in classical programs.


## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this workshop you will:

* Access IBM Quantum devices through the cloud
* Write quantum programs using Qiskit
* Deploy circuits on simulators and real quantum hardware
* Export and interpret results (JSON, CSV, plots)
* Integrate quantum outputs into classical Python workflows


## Structure (4 Days)

### Day 1 – IBM Quantum Cloud Basics

* Intro to IBM Quantum and free access model
* Workflow: submit → run → get results
* Hands-on: first circuit on simulator

**Materials**: PowerPoint + Jupyter Notebook



### Day 2 – Using Qiskit with IBM Cloud

* Qiskit structure and IBM Provider
* Building and visualizing circuits in Python
* Hands-on: Bell state on simulator

**Materials**: PowerPoint + Jupyter Notebook



### Day 3 – Running on Real Quantum Hardware

* IBM backends (simulators vs real devices)
* Job queueing, shots, noise, errors
* Hands-on: Grover’s algorithm on real backend

**Materials**: PowerPoint + Jupyter Notebook


### Day 4 – Integrating Results into Programs

* Exporting measurement data (JSON, CSV)
* Using results in Python code (optimization, ML)
* Mini-projects: hybrid workflows with Qiskit

**Materials**: PowerPoint + Jupyter Notebook


## Requirements

* Laptop with internet access
* IBM Quantum Experience account (free)
* Python 3.9+
* Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
* Qiskit installed

Install Qiskit with:

```bash
pip install qiskit
```
